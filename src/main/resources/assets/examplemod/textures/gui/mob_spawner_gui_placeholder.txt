This is a placeholder for the mob_spawner.png GUI texture file.

You need to create a 176x166 pixel PNG image named "mob_spawner.png" in this directory.

The texture should be a GUI background for the mob spawner configuration screen. You can:
1. Create your own custom GUI texture
2. Use a modified version of a vanilla GUI texture
3. Use any GUI texture as a temporary placeholder

The standard Minecraft GUI size is 176x166 pixels.

Once you have the texture file, delete this placeholder file and place your mob_spawner.png here.
