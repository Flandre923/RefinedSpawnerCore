This is a placeholder for the spawn_egg_mob_spawner.png GUI texture file.

You need to create a 176x166 pixel PNG image named "spawn_egg_mob_spawner.png" in this directory.

The texture should be a GUI background for the spawn egg mob spawner interface. You can:
1. Create your own custom GUI texture
2. Use a modified version of a vanilla GUI texture (like the chest GUI)
3. Use any GUI texture as a temporary placeholder

The standard Minecraft GUI size is 176x166 pixels.

For a quick start, you can:
1. Copy the vanilla chest GUI texture from Minecraft's assets
2. Rename it to "spawn_egg_mob_spawner.png"
3. Place it in this directory
4. Delete this placeholder file

The GUI should have:
- A slot area for the spawn egg at coordinates (80, 35)
- Standard player inventory slots at the bottom
- A title area at the top

Once you have the texture file, delete this placeholder file and place your spawn_egg_mob_spawner.png here.
