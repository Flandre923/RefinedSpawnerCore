# Mob Spawner Texture

You need to add a `mob_spawner.png` texture file (16x16 pixels) in this directory.

For now, you can:
1. Create your own custom texture
2. Use a modified version of the vanilla spawner texture from Minecraft
3. Use any existing block texture as a temporary placeholder

The texture should represent a mob spawner block that fits your mod's aesthetic.

Once you have the texture, place it as `mob_spawner.png` in this directory and delete this README file.
